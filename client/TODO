    * given a cluster name or ID plus registry credentials, a client
        should first obtain from the registry configuration 
        information on the cluster, which will include the IP addresses
        (endPoints) and public keys of cluster members
    * for testing purposes, expect the registry to be on port 44444
    * in production applications, expect the registry to be on 55555
