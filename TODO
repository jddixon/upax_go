    * in tests as in production first communications of a new 
        cluster are with xlReg on port 44444, default 127.0.0.1
        - cluster name defaults to "upax"
        - size defaults to 5
        - epCount is 2 (cluster-cluster, client-cluster)
        - default LFS is /var/app/upax for production, 
            ./tmp/SERVER_NAME for test, where SERVER_NAME is
            locally unique
        - expected xlReg version is 0.2.0 or better

2013-09-13  *** OBSOLETE ***
    * modify code so that Upax servers and clients use xlReg 
        to initiate communications (xlattice_go/reg/helloAndReply.go
        - attrs has two role bits, 00 = client, 01 = mirror, 10 = server

    * p.proto drops Hello, which is replaced by PeerHelloAndReply
        sequence, xlattice_go/msg/helloAndReply.go

    * begin the game with serialization of the UpaxNode to and from
        LFS
        - UpaxNode is serialized in reverse order, so 
            BaseNode | Node | UpaxNode
        - serialization is written to/loaded from LFS/.xlattice/config
        - by default, if that file exists it is loaded and configuration
            attributes are taken from the file

    * upaxNode/New has p []xn.Peer as a parameter, this should most
        certainly be a pointer or slice of pointers instead; fix
        and also fix xn.New, which is where the problem really is
