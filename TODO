    * we must have a regCred.dat for the server running on the test
        system in ./
    * a booting server without an LFS must find and parse ./regCred.dat
        to continue
        - once such a server has created its LFS it writes regCred.dat
            into it

    * in tests as in production first communications of a new
        cluster are with xlReg on port 44444, default 127.0.0.1
        - cluster name defaults to "upax"
        - size defaults to 5
        - epCount is 2 (cluster-cluster, client-cluster)
        - default LFS is /var/app/upax for production,
            ./tmp/SERVER_NAME for test, where SERVER_NAME is
            locally unique
        - expected xlReg version is 0.2.0 or better

    * upax_go/node looks to be useless

    * modify code so that Upax servers and clients use xlReg 	        * OBS
        to initiate communications (xlattice_go/reg/helloAndReply.go	* OBS
        - attrs has two role bits, 00 = client, 01 = mirror, 10 = server* OBS
	
    * p.proto drops Hello, which is replaced by PeerHelloAndReply	    * OBS

        - UpaxNode is serialized in reverse order, so 	                * OBS
            BaseNode | Node | UpaxNode	                                * OBS
        - serialization is written to/loaded from LFS/.xlattice/config	* OBS
        - by default, if that file exists it is loaded and configuration* OBS
            attributes are taken from the file	                        * OBS
	
    * upaxNode/New has p []xn.Peer as a parameter, this should most	    * OBS
        certainly be a pointer or slice of pointers instead; fix	    * OBS
        and also fix xn.New, which is where the problem really is	    * OBS
