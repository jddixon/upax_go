    * LogEntry.String() and Parse() support simple conversion 
        between in-memory objects and string files; need a
        Protobuf spec
        - but then need to be sure of ability to recover from 
            file corruption
        - same spec can of course be used to pass log entries
            between servers

    * doTestBodyLine needs better tests of paths
        - rnglib should generate random POSIX paths
        - and random email addresses
